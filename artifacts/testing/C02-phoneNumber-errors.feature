Feature: CAMARA Common Artifact C02 - Test scenarios for phoneNumber errors

    Common error scenarios for POST operations with phoneNumber as input either in the request
    body or implied from the access

    NOTES:
    * This is not a complete feature but a collection of scenarios that can be applied with minor
      modifications to test plans. Test plans would have to copy and adapt the scenarios as part of
      their own feature files, along with other scenarios.

    * These scenarios assume that other properties not explicitly mentioned in the scenario
      are set by default to a valid value. This can be specified in the feature Background.

    * {{feature_identifier}} has to be substituted to the value corresponding to the feature file where
    these scenarios are included.
