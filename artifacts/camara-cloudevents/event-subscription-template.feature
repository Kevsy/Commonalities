@<xxx> 
Feature: Camara Template Subscriptions API, v{version here} - Operations on subscriptions

  # This feature file is to be used by CAMARA sub projet when an event subscription ressource is provided.
  # We designed as <xxx> the subscription resource prefix.
  # We designed as <x> the event version. 
  #
  # If the subscription leverages 'device' object the following indication must be present:
  #    Implementation indications:
  #      * List of device identifier types which are not supported, among: phoneNumber, networkAccessIdentifier, ipv4Address, ipv6Address
  #
  # Testing assets:
  #        A sink-url identified as "callbackUrl", which receives notifications
  #        + Add here the specific testing asset(s) required to test the API
  #
  # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specifies in <xxx>-subscriptions.yaml
  # References to schemas starting with the # symbol are JSON Pointers from the root of the OAS document: <xxx>-subscriptions.yaml, Schema names are aligned with the event-subscription-template.yaml artifact.
  #
  # IMPORTANT: 
  # 1/ This file must be completed with test cases specific to the subscription type managed by the API.
  # 2/ Specific Subscription error scenarios when Device object is used must be added. These scenarios are available in CAMARA Github.   ################
